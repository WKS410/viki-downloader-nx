# viki-downloader-nx
The previous script had been removed due to the presence of some minor bugs, and simultaneously, I was dissatisfied with the design I had implemented on it.

The final version will be released soon! We are working with Python and Node.js. The new version will be based on the NX version that was used for CR and FUNi. I hope you can be patient.

This work has not been done for the purpose of earning money or anything similar. It is intended for the public. I simply admired the work of the NX versions, which inspired me to create my own version now. Anyway, please acknowledge that the previous version took me 2 hours to complete, which is why the design was kept simple. I hope you can understand.

I would like to thank all the users who have given me ideas to correct some errors and improve some things.
